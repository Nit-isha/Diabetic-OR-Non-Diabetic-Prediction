# Diabetic-OR-Non-Diabetic-Prediction

`Binary Classification`
`Support Vector Machine Model`

Building a system in Python that can predict whether the person is Diabetic or Not based on the [Recorded Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
For prediction Supervised Machine Learning Model is used and executed in Jupyter Notebook using Python.
Dataset is Standardised before processing to obtain accurate results.
Here, Support vector Machine (SVM) Model for Binary Classification problem. 
Model is trained for 70% of dataset and tested for 30% of dataset. 
Accuracy Score obtained for the test dataset was 78.78%.

### About DataSet

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

This model can be used to predict whether a women is Diabetic or Not by just entering the required input.
i.e., Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin thickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age.
